JavaScript: Pascal's Triangles:
---------------------------

This is some code I wrote to check out Jasmine, the testing framework for JavaScript.  The code creates two versions of Pascal's Triangles:

          1
         1 1
        1 2 1
       1 3 3 1
      1 4 6 4 1

Requires node.js to run:

JavaScript: Code for the Obama Campaign's www.barackobama.com/local:
---------------------------

I wrote about 40-50% of this. We had to make a lot of changes at the last second to please campaign headquarters. It's not the prettiest code I've seen, but it got through a rigorous testing program, and we shipped 4 weeks before the election.
